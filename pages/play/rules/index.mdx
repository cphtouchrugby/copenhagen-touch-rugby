The following is a loose intepretation of the rules of the game.

## Attack

If you pick the ball up from the ground you must pass it on before somebody touches you.

- Don't drop the ball
- Don't pass the ball forward
- Don't put the ball down if nobody has touched you

## Turnovers

- A turn over occurs if the ball is dropped.
- 6 touches are made.
- The scrum half or **dummy** is touched after **the mark** with no other attacking player having had possession of the ball.
- A player runs out of bounds.

## Defence

- One hand (light) touch
- Get back 5m or the try line

## Substitutions

- Subs can be made at any time from one side of the field.
- Substituting players must make contact with each other over the sideline.
