The following is a high level overview of the rules we play too.

## Attack

If you pick the ball up from the ground you must pass it on before somebody touches you.

- Don't drop the ball
- Don't pass the ball forward
- Don't put the ball down if nobody has touched you

To score a try

- Ball must be placed on or over the scoreline
- Ball does not have to be released to score a touchdown
- Dummy Half is not permitted to score touchdowns
- If a touch is made as the ball is being grounded â€“ the touch counts
- If a touch occurs in the touchdown zone, play restarts 5 metres infield from the scoreline

## Turnovers

A change of possession occurs when

- the ball is dropped to the ground
- 6 touches have been defended
- a player runs out of bounds
- Dummy Half touched while in possession
- incorrect rollball, **off the mark**

At a change of possession, play restarts with a ROLLBALL

## Rollball

Position at the mark where the touch was made

- Face attacking scoreline
- Without delay, roll the ball backwards between the legs
- Dummy Half must pick up the ball cleanly and play without delay
- At the rollball, the Referee shall indicate the touch count

## Defence

It is **not rugby**, aim to use one hand and maintain a _light_ touch.

- A touch can be affected by either a defending player or by the player in possession
- A touch counts on the ball, hair or clothing
