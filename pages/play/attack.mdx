To score a try a person other than the dummy half must put the ball down over the try line without being touched.

## Driving

Aim to gain as much ground as possible with low risk while making the defence scrabble backwards and become disjointed. Maintain a smooth attacking flow by keeping the time from a touch until the ball is in the dummy half's hands to a minimum.

### Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

As an attacker running with the ball aim to be predictable then get out the way and into a position to carry again if needed.

1. Run to the side of a defender but **don't try to beat them**
2. Make the touch, **don't wait to be touched**
3. Roll the ball slowly
4. Take a good step forwards
5. Step sideways to get out of way
6. Be a passing option for the dummy

When you attempting to make ground you should attempt to make it easy for your dummy-half to immediately scoop the ball up and run directly at the try line.

## Attacking Moves

Once you get near the line do some hard out moves.

- Do some deadly moves
