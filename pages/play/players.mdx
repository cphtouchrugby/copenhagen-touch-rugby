Touch rugby is a sport open to everyone with mixed teams playing at World Cups.

## Teams

6 players are allowed on the field at any one time but teams may have as many players in their squad as they want.

During tournament play, Mixed Teams must have at least two females on the pitch at all times. However a team can play a legal game with 4 players, with 1 female.

## Positions

- Middles x 2
- Links x 2
- Wings x 2

### Middles

Most consistent and fittest players.

Need to make as many yards as smoothly as possible on attack with the biggest workload on defence providing cover for the other middle and their link player.

### Links

Play either side of the two middles, and inside of the wingers.

The most elusive players with exceptional ball handling and footwork.

### Wings

Stand outside the links.

Fastest players in the team. Using their vision and speed to:

- shut down opposing break outs
- run into space to create numeric advantages
